Looking back at 2018, OCI had a banner year for foundational momentum ‚Äì perfect for all our community has planned for 2019 üóì

Some of our biggest moments of last year included the launch of the [Distribution Specification project](https://github.com/opencontainers/tob/blob/master/proposals/distribution.md), to standardize container image distribution based on the specification for the [Docker Registry HTTP API V2 protocol](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/5cb406d511b7b9163bff9b6439072e4892e5ae3b/docs/spec/api.md) ‚Äì the result of extensive work from key maintainers [Derek McGowan](https://twitter.com/derekmcgowan), [Stephen Day](https://twitter.com/stevvooe) and [Vincent Batts](https://twitter.com/vbatts), with backing from hundreds of OCI contributors and organizations committed to container standardization ‚Äì and the long-awaited [announcement of Alibaba Cloud‚Äôs membership](/posts/announcements/2018-08-29-oci-welcomes-alibaba-cloud) ‚Äì the last of top 5 major hyperscale clouds to join the initiative and largest cloud provider in China.

Additionally, OCI community members [Chris Aniszczyk](https://twitter.com/cra), [Jeffrey Borek](https://twitter.com/jeffborek), [Rithu Leena John](https://twitter.com/rithu_john), & [Patrick Chanezon](https://twitter.com/chanezon) secured a coveted speaking slot at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America to present **‚ÄúHow Standards, Specifications and Runtimes Make for Better Containers‚Äù** to a sold-out Seattle crowd. Check out a recording of their session below üé•

We also started publishing ecosystem features in an effort to highlight how OCI is being leveraged by various projects. These deep dives, which we plan to continue sharing in 2019, were a hit with maintainers and readers alike ‚Äì a sample of community usage posts shared in 2018 can be found below:

In 2019, the OCI community plans to roll out updates to specifications, ship a v1.0 of runc + much more ‚Äì [stay tuned](https://github.com/opencontainers), [get involved](/community), and follow along on [social](https://twitter.com/OCI_ORG) for an even bigger year of all things container standards & specs!
