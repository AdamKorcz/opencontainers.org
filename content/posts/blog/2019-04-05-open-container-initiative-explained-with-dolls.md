Have you ever tried to explain to a friend, or neighbor or your parent what containers are and received a blank or confused look as you try to describe them? Well, OCI community contributor and Stanford software engineer [Vanessa Sochat](https://twitter.com/vsoch/status/1110230957385232385) has the solution in her entertaining and creative video series. The first video helps viewers understand what a container is in a simple and easy to understand way.

The second video describes what OCI is and the upcoming final video in the series will explore the process for contributing to OCI Specifications. While the videos are entertaining and enlightening, they are also meant to highlight documentation Vanessa and the community have created that solves some challenges she encountered when getting involved with the OCI community. Vanessa, with a self-described passion for all things containers, and a love of the open source community decided to take action. She started to speak up about it with maintainers and with encouragement put together documentation to help newcomers.
