It‚Äôs 2018 and after shipping the [v1.0 specifications last year](/posts/blog/2017-07-19-oci-v1-0-bringing-containers-closer-to-standardization), we‚Äôre nearing contributions from 300+ contributors across 70+ organizations. Today the community is hard at work on future versions of OCI, including discussions around a [distribution API specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/tob/issues/34). For more details about releases and specifications in development, please visit https://github.com/opencontainers.

Also, the OCI [Technical Oversight Board (TOB)](https://www.opencontainers.org/about/technical-oversight-board) ‚Äì comprised of independently elected individuals who provide oversight of the technical leadership and serve as a point of appeal ‚Äì just elected the following five board members to each serve a two-year term, effective immediately:

- Taylor Brown (Microsoft)
- Stephen Day (Docker)
- Phil Estes (IBM)
- Jon Johnson (Google)
- Mrunal Patel (Red Hat)

These newest TOB members join the following existing members, who are each in the middle of a two-year term:

- Vincent Batts (Red Hat)
- Michael Crosby (Docker)
- Vishnu Kannan (Google)
- Greg Kroah-Hartman (Linux Foundation)

The TOB also voted to elect Michael Crosby (Docker) as the new Chair. This new TOB lineup is responsible for adding, removing or reorganizing OCI Projects ‚Äì to learn more, you can follow the TOB on GitHub [here](https://github.com/opencontainers/tob).

I‚Äôd also like to extend a big thank you to all of our outgoing TOB members ‚Äì Chris Wright, Diogo M√≥nica, Jason Bouzane, John Gossman and former Chair, Brandon Philips ‚Äì for their service and commitment. We look forward to your continued collaboration with and participation in OCI!

Next month, new TOB member Phil Estes of IBM will represent OCI on a panel at Container World on 2/28. Visit to learn more about his involvement in this session!

As always, we welcome any/all contributions from the container community ‚Äì as our success banks on the support and collaboration of many. If you‚Äôre interested in contributing to OCI, please join the [OCI developer community](/community). For those who are building products on OCI technology, we recommend [joining as a member](/join) and participating in the [future certification program](/community/certified).
