Following the recent release of OCI v1.0 ([runtime-spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc4) / [image-spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc4)) and a summer break, the work continues and the community is busy.

We had a great panel and strong showing on site at [Open Source Summit North America](events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-north-america) last week in Los Angeles, entitled, “Open Container Initiative: What’s Next For Standards and Container Portability?”.

Furthermore, we’re [partnering with Docker](/news/2017-08-21-fostering-diversity-and-inclusivity-at-dockercon-europe) to support diversity and inclusivity at DockerCon Europe as one of the official DockerCon Europe Diversity Scholarship sponsors. We continue to work towards our [certification program](/community/certified), due out in the near future.

Additionally, the community has just elected two new maintainers for the OCI image specification:

- [Aleksa Sarai](https://github.com/cyphar) (SUSE)
- [Keyang Xie](https://github.com/xiekeyang) (Huawei)

Both Aleksa and Keyang have been fantastic contributors to the OCI community. According to fellow maintainers, Aleksa has been invaluable with feedback, brainstorming and fixes/features all the way through the stack while Keyang has heavily contributed to improved overall quality and testing of the image specification.

As always, contributions from across the industry are welcome; our success depends on the support and collaboration of many. If you’re interested in contributing, please join the [OCI developer community](/community) which is open to anyone. If you’re building products based on OCI technology, we recommend [joining as a member](/join) and participating in the [upcoming certification program](https://github.com/opencontainers/oci-conformance).
