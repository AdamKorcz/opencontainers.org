The [Open Container Initiative (OCI)](https://www.opencontainers.org/), the open-source community in charge of creating container standards, has announced the launch of the [Distribution Specification project](https://github.com/opencontainers/tob/blob/master/proposals/distribution.md.md) to standardize container image distribution. This new standard is based on the [Docker Registry v2 protocol](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/5cb406d511b7b9163bff9b6439072e4892e5ae3b/docs/spec/api.md). It standardizes container image distribution, which supports the pushing and pulling of container images.
