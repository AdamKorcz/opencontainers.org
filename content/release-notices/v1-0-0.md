This release is comprised of [Runtime Specification v1.0.0](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/releases/tag/v1.0.0) (a specification for managing the lifecycle of a container) and [Image Format Specification v1.0.0](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/releases/tag/v1.0.0) (a specification for a container image format). This release is no small feat, and we are incredibly proud of the OCI community of 200+ contributors for all the hard work that went into this release!
