As mentioned in our first post of 2019, this year is shaping up to be our busiest yet. The OCI community plans to roll out updates to specifications, ship a v1.0 of runc + much more, all in the next few months!

One exciting new development ready to share is the selection of the following four board members, elected to each serve a two-year term on the [OCI Technical Oversight Board (TOB)](/about/tob) ‚Äì comprised of independently elected individuals who provide oversight of the technical leadership and serve as a point of appeal:

- Vincent Batts (Red Hat)
- Michael Crosby (Docker)
- Aleksa Sarai (SUSE)
- Derek McGowan (Docker)

These newest TOB members join the following existing members, who are each in the middle of two-year terms:

- Taylor Brown (Microsoft)
- Stephen Day (Cruise)
- Phil Estes (IBM)
- Jon Johnson (Google)
- Mrunal Patel (Red Hat)

The TOB also voted to elect Michael Crosby (Docker) as the 2019 Chair. To learn more about the term limits, the function of the board + more, you can follow TOB activity [here](https://github.com/opencontainers/tob) on GitHub.

We‚Äôd love to extend a big thank you to all of our outgoing TOB members ‚Äì Vishnu Kannan and Greg Kroah-Hartman ‚Äì for their commitment to OCI and its growing project community. We look forward to your continued collaboration on all things container standards!

As always, we welcome any + all contributions from the community ‚Äì our progress this year banks on the support and collaboration of many üëçüèº
