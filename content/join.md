## Overview

The Open Container Initiative (OCI) is an open source technical community within which industry participants may easily contribute to building a vendor-neutral, portable and open specification and runtime that deliver on the promise of containers as a source of application portability backed by a certification program.

Of course, as an open source project, we welcome anyone to get involved in the development community, regardless of membership status.  Please visit the [Community](/community) page for details on technical calls, mailing lists, Github and more.  If you are interested in learning more about corporate membership, please see the details below and complete the inquiry form.
