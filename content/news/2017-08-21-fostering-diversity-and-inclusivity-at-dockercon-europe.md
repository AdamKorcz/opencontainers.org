It’s incredibly important to the Open Container Initiative (OCI) community, as well as the larger container ecosystem, to build a community of inclusiveness that helps provide opportunities to underrepresented and disadvantaged groups around the world. We strongly believe the power of collaboration is heightened when many different perspectives are included, with massive benefits to the broader tech ecosystem.

To that end, we are pleased to help underrepresented members of the container community the opportunity to attend [DockerCon Europe](https://europe-2017.dockercon.com/) (October 16-19) in Copenhagen this year as one of the official DockerCon Europe Diversity Scholarship sponsors! Together with Docker, we’re helping to foster inclusivity by providing a financial scholarship – including conference pass, airfare, hotel accommodations, and a mentorship – to those who may not have the resources or support to attend on their own. Winners of the scholarship will also receive hands-on access to the resources, tools, and community support needed to further accelerate educational and career growth.

**Applications are due Tuesday, 5 September, 2017 at 5:00PM PST. More details on the program and how to apply are available here: https://blog.docker.com/2017/08/dockercon-europe-diversity-scholarship/**

DockerCon is one of the container industry’s premiere events where practitioners come to learn from enthusiasts and experts. It’s all about learning, sharing, connecting, and innovating on the next generation distributed systems.

We plan on sharing a booth with our sister Linux Foundation collaborative project, the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF). Please stop by the booth to learn more about OCI, CNCF, the wider Linux Foundation container ecosystem, and how OCI integrates with the CNCF community and projects (Kubernetes, Prometheus, OpenTracing, Fluentd, Linkerd, gRPC, CoreDNS, containerd, rkt and CNI).

As always, we  encourage you to look for ways to get involved in OCI, either as an official [member](/join) or as part of our open developer [community](/community).
