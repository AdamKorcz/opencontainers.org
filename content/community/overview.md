# Connect with the Open Container Initiative community

The technical community working on developing standards around container formats and runtime technology.  Get Involved!

## Open meetings

The technical community hosts an open meeting monthly on Wednesdays rotating between 08:00 AM PDT and 17:00 PM PDT. Everyone is welcome to participate via [Zoom](https://zoom.my.us/opencontainers).  An initial agenda will be posted to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/opencontainers.org/forum/#!forum/dev) earlier in the week, and everyone is welcome to propose additional topics or suggest other agenda alterations there. Minutes are posted to the mailing list and minutes from past calls are archived to the [wiki](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/wiki) for those who are unable to join the call.
