We’re pleased to be supporting the Open Source Convention (OSCON) [Open Container Day](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/full/open-container-day) this year, taking place Tuesday, May 9th at the Austin Convention Center in Austin, TX.

Open Container Day is a gathering of industry practitioners presenting their takes around forward-thinking, container-based solutions, infrastructure, orchestration, cloud-native computing, continuous delivery, DevOps, microservices, and where this industry segment is going in 2017 and beyond. The event will feature vendor-neutral, straightforward discussions.  Among other industry experts, OCI community members will be presenting during the event, including: 


- Phil Estes of IBM will speak on “[Quantifying container runtime performance: A serverless platform case study](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/59605).” Containers are already “fast” in one sense: compared to VMs, the start time of a container seems instantaneous. But certain use cases care about the milliseconds needed to perform container lifecycle operations. Phil Estes offers an overview of an open source container benchmarking project that arose out of using containers as the runtime vehicle for a serverless framework.
- “[Where Have Containers Gotten Us?](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/60754)”, presented by Vincent Batts of Red Hat.  As a technology, containers are maturing at a rapid pace. Vincent Batts explores the state of the ecosystem and how it is standardizing and offers a glimpse at what’s in store for the future.
- “[Service discovery in container orchestration](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/59939)”, presented by Arun Gupta from Amazon, will offer an overview of service discovery in different container orchestration frameworks, drawing on an example of a Java application talking to a database to demonstrate configurations in Docker, Kubernetes, DC/OS, and Amazon ECS—commonly used container orchestration platforms that all have built-in support for service discovery and scalability.

We’re looking forward to a great day of discussion, networking, and diverse perspectives on where the container space is headed, especially as we gear up to release v 1.0 of our [image format](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec) and container [runtime](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec) specifications.
